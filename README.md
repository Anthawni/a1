## File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic
- `MakeFile`: Script for compiling the program
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the program.


## Compile Instructions 
- Make sure that a GCC or G++ compiler is installed on your system
- Open up an terminal window and navigate your way to the "a3" directory containing the source files.
- Run the command "make" to compile the source code ,main.cpp'.

## Operating Instructions 
- Following compilation run the executable that is produced with the following command "./sim".
- Check out the outputs for End of First Fit Allocation and End of Best Fit Allocation

## File Descriptions
main.cpp - is the core source file of the file that contains the implementation of the following functionalities. 
Makefile - is a script that automates the compilation process of the project, ensuring dependencies are managed and the executable "sim" is generated

## Known Issues 
During our development Jeremiah and I ran into some issues such as the first and best fit being printed identical and the average nodes traversed being negative. 

## Design Decisions
We didn't stray away from the instructions to add anything fancy. With the example outputs we wanted to ensure we had something close to picture perfect. 

## Lessons Learned
Jeremiah and I learned the following:

- Implementing memory allocation and deallocation using first fit and best fit techniques
- Handling allocation and deallocation
- Managing and optimizing memory usage
- Debugging and refining code to ensure correct implementation
